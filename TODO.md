## Things that annoy me
- comments continue on next line
- indenting for css/js in html file
- commenting
- Yaml indenting
- Renaming should highlight the previous name
- Autosave when moving buffers

## Nice to haves
- tailwind custom css highlighting
- markdown preview
- debugger
- git diff (preview)
- Jenkins linting
- show markers
- show usages?
